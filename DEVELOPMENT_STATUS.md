# Development Status

Last updated: 2026-07-14

## Current State

- Conversation pipeline migration Phases 1-5 are merged on `master`: pure domain contracts/renderers, shadow transport, authoritative player-candidate validation, atomic player conversation commit, exact compatibility mapping, structured player history/delivery, explicit pre-cutover drain, and browser/CLI sink acknowledgement. Migration feature flags remain default-off with strict dependencies.
- Phase 4 writes exactly one strict `PlayerLegacyDisplayCompatibilityRecord` for each structured player publication and unchanged legacy entry in the same atomic `N -> N+1` transaction. Phase 5 resolves that identity without positional/text inference and keeps history, live delivery, and acknowledgement separate.
- Phase 6 architecture is defined in `docs/conversation-pipeline-design.md`. The merged foundation provides the default-off flag, engine-owned logical/attempt identity domains, pure known-information projection, and no-op route compatibility; it does not call a candidate provider or perform an NPC structured commit.
- The browser-safe engine identity/fingerprint implementation and SHA-256 boundary coverage are merged. No weak random fallback, Node-only browser import, dependency, polyfill, or bundler was added.
- The Phase 6 NPC candidate-validation contract is defined authoritatively, including its exact request/response envelopes, proposal union, target and disclosure authorization, candidate fingerprint, immutable `ValidatedNpcReactionCandidate`, closed validation-result union, redacted rejection contract, and validation-only lifecycle boundary. Production candidate-validation implementation has not started, and the previously blocked Phase 6 implementation Goal has not been resumed.
- Validation-only success is explicitly nonauthoritative: no descriptor/claim/event/publication/commit ID, delta, `N+1 -> N+2`, display, acknowledgement, or legacy fallback is created by candidate validation.
- Exact replay performs no redisplay or provider call, and all migration feature flags remain default-off.
- `WerewolfGame` owns session/turn/order/version metadata for both browser and CLI and applies each compatibility command as one isolated authoritative transaction.
- 5-player werewolf prototype is implemented.
- Current roles are 1 werewolf, 1 seer, and 3 citizens.
- The game can run through player question, NPC response, vote, execution, night, seer action, werewolf attack, and win check.
- NPC response generation uses an injectable asynchronous provider interface.
- Added a secure server-side OpenAI response provider using the official Responses API raw HTTP shape.
- Support for `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` with strict environment variable configuration.
- Server-side API endpoints: `GET /api/runtime-config` and `POST /api/npc-response`.
- Implemented strict server-side request validation with a 64 KiB byte-limit and allowlisted fields.
- Redaction of private evidence (seer results) when public claim is not allowed.
- Browser-side `HttpResponseProvider` and `SessionManager` for robust stale response prevention and request cancellation.
- Configurable concurrency limit and RPM limit for OpenAI calls.
- Transient error fallback to `PseudoResponseProvider` for game continuity.
- Added a controlled one-call real OpenAI smoke-test workflow (`npm run smoke:openai`) for local verification.
- UI-independent asynchronous action API is available through `await dispatchPlayerAction(action)`.
- Public UI state can be read through `getPublicSnapshot()`.
- A first browser UI adapter is available through `npm.cmd run web`.
- **Developer Mode** is implemented in the browser UI, providing detailed diagnostics including raw Responses API status, error details, and fallback status.
- Player-facing logs and developer logs are separated.
- Core game, conversation contracts, Phase 2-5 migration boundaries, Phase 6 inert foundation/projection, browser-safe identity generation, response-provider invariants, diagnostics, configuration, request validation, and API endpoints have automated coverage. The current verified count is recorded below.

## Last Verified

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commands:
  - `npm.cmd test`
  - `npm.cmd run sample`
  - `git diff --check`
  - documentation JSON/schema/fingerprint, UTF-8, conflict-marker, privacy/secret, and forbidden-Unicode validation
- Result: 300/300 tests passed. `npm.cmd run sample`, `git diff --check`, all normative JSON examples, projection/echo/fingerprint checks, conflict-marker scan, privacy/secret scan, and forbidden-Unicode scan passed. No `.mjs` file changed in this docs-only work.
- **Real OpenAI Smoke Test**:
  - Result: PASS
  - Date: 2026-07-01
  - Model: `gpt-5.4-mini`
  - Provider: `openai`
  - Outbound requests: Exactly 1 billable request
  - Status: Completed (HTTP 200)
  - Fallback used: False
  - Retries: Disabled
  - Usage: 571 input tokens, 27 output tokens (598 total)
  - Elapsed time: 2378 ms
  - Security: API key was not committed or stored. Key was removed from the local shell environment immediately after verification (Test-Path Env:OPENAI_API_KEY returned False).
  - Scope: Validates controlled local integration using the production server and provider paths. This does not make the project production-ready; authentication and distributed rate limiting remain unimplemented.

## Next Recommended Task

1. Define and approve a new validation-only implementation Goal from the latest `master`, following the implementation sequence in section 25A.
2. Keep authoritative preparation/commit, `N+1 -> N+2`, publication, retry/timeout coordination, provider routing, and Renderer migration in their later separately reviewed stages.

2. `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`
3. `ROADMAP.md`
4. `DECISIONS.md`

9. `tests/gameEngine.test.mjs`

## Current Git/GitHub State

- Local Git repository exists.
- GitHub private repository exists: `https://github.com/rggpix976/llm-werewolf-game`
- `origin` is configured as `https://github.com/rggpix976/llm-werewolf-game.git`.
- Local `master` tracks `origin/master`.
- The authoritative Phase 6 docs define candidate validation without changing Phase 4/5 runtime behavior. Production candidate validation and later provider/coordinator/commit/publication work remain unimplemented.
- Game state is intentionally kept in memory only; save/load is not planned.

## Working Rule

At the end of each development session:

- Run the relevant verification command.
- Update this file with the latest status.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Commit the completed work.
